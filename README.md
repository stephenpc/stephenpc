### Hello 👋 and Welcome

If you're reading this, it means I finally spent a few minutes figuring out how to do the profile `README` goodness on GitHub. This seems redundant to the built-in profile, so this may not change for five or more years, much like my dotcom. Time will tell.

### Other Places of "Interest"

#### If you're bored...

* [10+ years of 🎧 scrobbles to Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/stephenpc) ~ _Maybe we're musical neighbors_

#### If you're interested in hiring me to write code that automates software development pipelines or virtual/cloud infrastructure, tell corny jokes, and bombard engineering chat rooms with animated GIFs...
